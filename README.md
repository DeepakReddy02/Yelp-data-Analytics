# Yelp-data-Analytics

I did a comprehensive analysis on Yelp dataset containing thousands of businesses across the United States, focusing on three key service categories: "Delivery","Plumbing", and "Air Conditioning & Heating".Using PySpark for scalable data processing, I cleaned and standardized the dataset, tackling challenges like Duplicate and missing values.Did some EDA as well to see how the data is distributed

I discovered intriguing regional variationsâ€”certain states consistently outperformed others in service quality, while some cities showed surprising gaps between customer demand and satisfaction levels. The correlation between review volume and ratings revealed interesting customer behavior patterns that challenge conventional wisdom.

This project showcases how big data analytics can transform business decision-making, turning scattered customer feedback into actionable market intelligence. The insights range from identifying high-performing business models to revealing untapped market potential across America's diverse economic landscape
